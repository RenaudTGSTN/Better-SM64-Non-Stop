# Super Mario 64 but getting a star doesn't exit the level
This project is forked from the [Super Mario 64 decomp project](https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64). For more info concerning the decomp project please go there.

The repository's name is very long. Please rename the main folder to compile the game.

The project still has some bugs. The most annoying one is that the music stops when getting a star. But otherwise it still plays well.

I decided to make these modifications because i hear a lot of people say that Mario 64 didn't age well and that it should let you play in the level when getting a star. So there you go. That's only 2 or 3 line of codes to change. I'm surprised no one did this before.
