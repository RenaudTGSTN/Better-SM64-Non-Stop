# Super Mario 64 but getting a star doesn't exit the level
This project is forked from the [Super Mario 64 decomp project](https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64). For more info concerning the decomp project please go there.

This is essentially sm64 non-stop but with animation. (and more stuff planned for the future to make the experience more polished).

The repository's name is very long. Please rename the main folder to compile the game.

The project still has some minor bugs and my modifications are a little bit messy but the game still plays well.

I decided to make these modifications because i hear a lot of people say that Mario 64 didn't age well and that it should let you play in the level when getting a star. So there you go. That's only 2 or 3 line of codes to change. I'm surprised no one did this before.
